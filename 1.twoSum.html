 <pre>
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.

/**
Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Your solution is indeed effective, but it has several performance issues and areas for improvement, especially when dealing with larger arrays. The main problems are as follows:
1. High Time Complexity
O(n²) Time Complexity: Your solution uses two nested loops, resulting in a time complexity of O(n²). This is inefficient for larger arrays. For example, if the length of nums increases to thousands or tens of thousands, the performance will significantly degrade.

2. Unnecessary Calculations
Redundant Calculations: In the inner loop, you compute the sum for every pair of elements. If a match is not found, those calculations are completely unnecessary. Using a hash table can help avoid redundant calculations and check for matching elements in constant time.

3. Readability and Maintainability
Loop Structure: While your logic is clear, the nested loops are not the most optimal approach, which might confuse other developers when maintaining the code, as this implementation isn't concise or straightforward.

function twoSum1(nums, target) {
  const result = []
  for(let i=0,len=nums.length;i<len;i++) {
    for(let j=i+1 ;j<len; j++){
      if(nums[i]+nums[j] === target){
        result.push(i,j)
        break
      }
    }

  return result

/**
Time Complexity: O(n)

Improved Solution
You can optimize your code by using a hash map to reduce the time complexity to O(n). Here’s an example of the improved code
 */
function twoSum2(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map() // create a hash map
  for(let i=0,len=nums.length;i<len;i++){
    const complement = target - nums[i] // Calculate the complement 
    if(map.has(complement)){ // check if the complement exists in the map
      return [map.get(complement),i] // return the result
    }
    map.set(nums[i],i) // add the current element to the map
  }
  return [] // return an empty array if no solution is found
}
